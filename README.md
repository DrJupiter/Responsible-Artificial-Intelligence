### Course Overview: Responsible AI

**General Course Objectives**

This course introduces students to ethical challenges in AI and provides tools to understand and address them. Key topics include:

- Paradigms and limitations of machine learning (Epistemology)
- Fairness and bias
- Explainable-AI
- Privacy

Students will engage with current state-of-the-art topics and recent publications from relevant ML conferences and journals. They will also implement prototypes of the presented algorithms and share their observations and results with the class.

**Learning Objectives**

The course aims to enhance knowledge in four major areas of responsible AI:

1. **Understanding AI:** Gain a deep understanding of AI, including common assumptions and responsible AI development practices.
2. **Fairness and Bias:** Learn about the challenges and state-of-the-art solutions for fairness and bias in AI.
3. **Explainable-AI:** Gain hands-on experience with deep neural network interpretations and explainable-AI techniques.
4. **Privacy:** Work with privacy-preserving models and training strategies.

**Content**

The course is divided into four parts:

1. **Ethics and Epistemology of AI:**
   - Ethical considerations in AI
   - Epistemology of machine learning
   - Model-fitting vs. artificial intelligence
   - Bayesian problems and limitations

2. **Fairness in AI:**
   - Review of classical algorithmic fairness algorithms
   - Limitations and potential solutions

3. **Explainable-AI:**
   - Saliency and prototype-based methods
   - Use cases and validation of explainable-AI methods

4. **Privacy in AI:**
   - Differential privacy
   - Federated learning

This comprehensive approach ensures students build a robust understanding of responsible AI practices, preparing them to tackle ethical challenges in AI development and deployment.
